## Installation

Releases are published to GitHub Packages and served publicly through jscdn:

```sh
bun add https://jscdn.tscircuit.com/@tscircuit/bus-lanes-solver/latest.tgz
```

Pin the resolved release version in your dependency URL for reproducible installs.
The release contains bundled JavaScript and TypeScript declarations in `dist`;
Git checkouts, test fixtures, examples, and development dependencies are excluded.

Run `bun run test:package` to build and validate the actual tarball in an isolated
consumer before publishing.

Step-based, via-free bus routing for `SimpleRouteJson`, with `BaseSolver` and `GenericSolverDebugger` from `@tscircuit/solver-utils`.

```ts
import { BusLanesSolver } from "@tscircuit/bus-lanes-solver"

const solver = new BusLanesSolver(simpleRouteJson)
solver.solve()
if (solver.failed) throw new Error(solver.error!)
const routed = solver.getOutput()
```

Each connection must have exactly two terminals on the same fixed layer. The solver never emits vias, changes terminal layers, or falls back to a multilayer router. Existing copper and obstacles remain fixed. Geometric winding sweeps, seam rotations and reverse searches choose lane order; planar congestion, crossed lane orders, unsupported constraints, and exhausted search budgets produce explicit failures. A bounded visibility-graph search failure is not a proof that no continuous planar solution exists.

## Review target

The integrated preset routes the original TSX from the
[AM3352/RAM reference](https://tscircuit.com/seveibar/am3352-ram-dogbone-and-single-layer-route-test)
with its custom algorithms replaced by `autorouter="bus_lanes"` in
[core #4237](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/4237). All 47 signals are computed
from pads, obstacles, and constraints. No saved route plan is replayed.

![Completed AM3352 routing across all three signal layers](docs/routed-am3352/solved.png)

Acceptance requires zero DRC errors, via-free interconnects after local escapes,
short ordinary runs with few direction changes, no self-touching copper or acute
reversals, smooth length-tuning curves, coupled pair shapes, and the declared bus
and pair skew limits. The existing four DDR benchmarks alone do not establish
this result.

The AM3352 regression measures these limits independently of the solver:

| Measurement | Reviewed reference | Generated result | Regression limit |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Connected signals / native DRC errors | 47 / 0 | 47 / 0 | 47 / 0 |
| Total planar copper | 1696.53 mm | 1549.71 mm | ≤1700 mm |
| Maximum / mean detour ratio | 2.536 / 1.723 | 2.047 / 1.546 | ≤2.6 / ≤1.75 |
| Ordinary turns / short jogs | 888 / 451 | 540 / 145 | ≤900 / ≤460 |
| Acute corners | — | 0 | 0 |
| Byte-bus / maximum differential skew | Within declared bounds | 0.635 / 0.127 mm | ≤0.635 / ≤0.127 mm |
| Pair interior edge gap | 0.11979–0.13813 mm | 0.11213–0.13813 mm | 0.0999–0.155 mm |

The original reference audit allows 6.2 mm at each end for package approaches.
The powered placement benchmark below additionally audits all copper outside
native package/fanout regions, including the approaches.
The quality limits supplement connectivity, continuous DRC, and visual review.

The main review path is:

1. `bus-lanes-pipeline-solver.ts`: preserve existing fanouts; escape only untouched
   component pads; compose the routing and tuning stages.
2. `bus-lanes-solver.ts`: complete fixed-layer connections and validate the result.
3. `coupled-pair-routing.ts` and `tune-coupled-lengths.ts`: shared pair corridors
   and shared smooth meanders.
4. `refine-pair-approaches.ts`: tighten parallel approaches, replace acute
   corners with legal bevels, and continue shared pair geometry through bends.
   Refinement runs after allocating tuning space and preserves other-net copper.
5. The AM3352 TSX regression in core: 47 routes, native DRC, independent quality
   measurements, and three routed signal-layer snapshots. The fresh run passed
   in approximately 281 seconds in the initial implementation. See the powered
   four-placement benchmark below for current runtimes.

## Constraints

- `buses[].connectionNames`: connections belonging to the bus, in routing order.
- `buses[].maxLengthSkew`: maximum difference in total planar copper lengths, in millimeters, including fixed traces associated by `source_trace_id` or `connection_name`. The solver adds clearance-checked tuning detours and verifies the final result.
- `buses[].traceWidth`: explicit width in millimeters; otherwise uses connection `nominalTraceWidth` / `width`, then `minTraceWidth`.
- `buses[].allowedLayers`: must contain the fixed terminal layer.
- `differentialPairs[].lengthTolerance`: supported as a routed-length constraint. Pairs with `traceGap` use a shared corridor. An explicit `maxUncoupledLength` bounds total uncoupled copper, including fixed fanouts.

Matching includes both fixed fanouts and the routes produced by this phase. It measures XY copper length; via depth, layer-dependent propagation velocity, and package delays are not inferred. No impedance or delay defaults are supplied. Matching uses the existing core SRJ fields: bus `maxLengthSkew` and differential-pair `lengthTolerance` (mapped from the JSX pair’s `maxLengthSkew`). Routes already inside the bound remain untuned; shorter routes grow only to the permitted lower bound. Overlapping bus and pair constraints are resolved together without forcing exact equality.

## tscircuit integration

The accompanying core/props changes introduce:

```tsx
<autoroutingphase name="DATA_LANES" phaseIndex={1} autorouter="bus_lanes" />
<bus
  name="DATA"
  connections={["DATA0", "DATA1"]}
  routingPhaseIndex={1}
  maxLengthSkew="0.1mm"
  pcbTraceWidth="0.15mm"
/>
```

The integrated phase adds local dogbones only for untouched component pads that need a signal-layer transition. Existing fanout handoffs retain their layers and geometry. Failed lane routing does not trigger a global-router fallback.

## Debugger

```sh
bun install
bun run start
bun run build:site
```

Cosmos shows four full AM62L DDR phase captures and a skew-tolerance example.
Each AM62L page has two separate, real `FanoutSolver` outputs and all 33 DDR
signals waiting to be routed. The enclosing regions are 17.76 mm apart, with a
4 mm transverse package offset. Fixed and newly routed copper share stable
layer colors; all layers are present at iteration zero, including via rings.
The SoC remains unrotated.

```sh
bun test
bun run typecheck
./benchmark.sh
bun run format:check
```

The repository follows the [handbook bootstrapping guide](https://github.com/tscircuit/handbook/blob/main/guides/bootstrapping-repos.md): Bun, vanilla TypeScript package exports, Biome, CI and a Vite/React Cosmos site. `vercel.json` exports Cosmos for deployment.

## AM3352 placement benchmark

`./benchmark.sh` runs exactly four AM3352/RAM samples. The AM3352 stays at
(0, 0) mm, and only the RAM is translated; both chips retain their orientation.
Board coordinates use +X right and +Y up.

| Sample | RAM center (mm) |
| --- | --- |
| Original control | (0, -27) |
| Right | (27, 0) |
| Left | (-27, 0) |
| Above | (0, 27) |

The [fixture loader](scripts/am3352-samples.ts) uses one native core phase
capture, the original 47 DDR signal connections, two byte buses, and three
differential pairs. Signal routes are computed from the pads every run.
Only RAM pads, terminals, and their associated fixed power geometry move.
The older AM62L examples remain separate regression fixtures; the benchmark
does not run those cases, mixed-layer negatives, or carrier-prefix samples.

Before signal routing, both chips' supply and ground pads have immutable local
dogbones generated by `FanoutSolver`. Their wire copper and through-via barrels
are supplied in `input.traces`, so signal dogboning, lane search, and validation
all see them as obstacles. CPU voltage domains remain separate. The three
`CAP_VDD_*` outputs and `VDD_MPU_MON` each retain their own identity; this study
adds local escapes without defining power-plane connectivity. Coverage is
161 pads: 122 on the AM3352 and 39 on RAM, including the reference's ground ties
for `VREFN`, `RTC_KALDO_ENn`, and `VPP`. Input/options/output records and
pad ownership are saved in [the fixture directory](tests/fixtures/am3352-ram).

The benchmark checks fixed fanout provenance, exact pad joins, complete power
coverage, and fixed-copper DRC before routing. A completed sample additionally
requires all 47 signal connections, unchanged power copper, one signal layer
(`inner1`, `inner2`, or `bottom`) between each trace's two terminal vias,
combined-copper DRC, byte-bus skew
within 0.635 mm, and differential-pair skew within 0.127 mm. Matching measures
full pad-to-pad planar copper, including signal dogbones.
Top-layer copper is limited to the component pads and their local dogbone stubs;
the independent output audit rejects top-layer carriers, including control nets.

Each sample runs in a fresh process, serially, with a 180-second routing budget.
Override it with `./benchmark.sh --timeout-seconds 60`. All four cases are always
attempted and their results written to `benchmark-results.json`. Failed searches
and timeouts are failures in the completion score. By default the command records
these measured outcomes and exits nonzero for invalid fixtures, worker crashes,
or invalid completed copper. Use `./benchmark.sh --require-all-solved` for a
strict gate that also exits nonzero when any sample remains unrouted. CI runs the
same four-case measurement and uploads the result JSON.

The powered benchmark completes **4/4 placements under 30 seconds each** on
macOS arm64 with Bun 1.3.2. Run the same strict check with
`./benchmark.sh --timeout-seconds 30 --require-all-solved`.

| Sample | Routing | Including validation | Signals | Native DRC | Byte 0 / byte 1 skew | DQS0 / DQS1 / clock skew |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Control | 13.349 s | 15.477 s | 47/47 | Pass | 0.635 / 0.635 mm | 0.127 / 0.127 / 0.073 mm |
| Right | 16.730 s | 21.814 s | 47/47 | Pass | 0.635 / 0.635 mm | 0.127 / 0.127 / 0.103 mm |
| Left | 19.773 s | 25.541 s | 47/47 | Pass | 0.635 / 0.635 mm | 0.029 / 0.127 / 0.105 mm |
| Above | 25.646 s | 30.638 s | 47/47 | Pass | 0.635 / 0.635 mm | 0.127 / 0.127 / 0.127 mm |

All four preserve the 161 power dogbones and have zero separated pair length
outside the native pad/fanout regions. The exterior audit checks both rails along
their actual copper, including meanders; it does not exempt a fixed approach
length. Ordinary bends are octilinear, and tuning uses smooth curves. Runtime
varies by machine; these timings include routing and length matching, with
native DRC and fixture validation reported separately in the total column.

For backward-facing packages, the pipeline routes shared pair corridors and
repairs a nearly complete bus together with its newly generated local signal
sites. Native supplied copper remains hard throughout. Package coupling is
extended while preserving already matched internal compensation, then the bus
and pair lengths are revalidated without raising the bus length target.

Generate the four completed review images with
`bun scripts/snapshot-routed-am3352.ts docs/routed-am3352-placements 30`.
The exporter validates all four before writing any images:
[control](docs/routed-am3352-placements/control-solved.png),
[right](docs/routed-am3352-placements/right-solved.png),
[left](docs/routed-am3352-placements/left-solved.png), and
[above](docs/routed-am3352-placements/above-solved.png).

The router checks continuous copper clearance while searching octilinear paths.
Clear channels use analytic connectors. Dense inputs use a grid search with turn
penalties, negotiated congestion, geometry-derived waypoint alternatives, and
bounded candidate selection. Candidate pairs remain atomic. Search never loads a
saved route plan; package envelopes, bus membership, and existing copper determine
the alternatives. Bus corridors are routed and tuned before unrelated controls.
A search-budget failure is explicit and does not export partial successful routes.

See the [visual iteration audit](./docs/vector-routing.md) for inspected baseline
and replacement snapshots. Cosmos includes a staggered obstacle channel in
addition to all four real AM62L captures.

Future changes must be submitted through pull requests with reviewed visual snapshots for all four DDR samples. See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

### Meander geometry

The integrated matcher packs rounded meanders into narrow banks before trying
wider corridors. Cell count comes from the usable run length and minimum bend
radius; paired curves include both rail offsets when calculating that radius.
This spends available longitudinal space on more cells, reducing transverse
excursion without tightening bend radii or separating pairs. Existing fanouts
remain fixed, and wider candidates remain available when compact packing fails.

Across the four powered AM3352 placements, this reduces signal bounding area by
**32–39%** versus PR #12, overall copper bounds by **31–39%**, and total
copper length by **12–15%**. See the
[footprint comparison](docs/routed-am3352-placements/README.md) for per-placement
bounds, centerline excursion, and timings.

Length tuning prioritizes long runs over short terminal approaches and centers evenly pitched serpentine lobes along them. The integrated preset uses rounded curves for both individual lanes and shared pair centerlines. Lobe count scales with the required added length, spreading large corrections without turning small corrections into dense teeth. Chamfers scale with lobe dimensions instead of a fixed microscopic corner cut. Returning arms retain at least three trace widths of center-to-center spacing (and the requested copper clearance). When the shortest lanes leave no room, the router opens an octilinear central corridor in winding order and rematches all affected bus lengths. Endpoints and fixed fanouts remain unchanged.

The [routed artifacts](./docs/routed-ddr) contain complete boards. All new carrier bends in the DDR samples are checked to turn by at most 45 degrees; length matching and combined-copper DRC remain mandatory.

## Integrated local-dogbone pipeline (experimental)

`BusLanesPipelineSolver(input, { fanout: "auto" })` composes local terminal
escapes with the fixed-layer lane solver. Automatic escapes are only eligible at
component pads without an existing connected route. Supplied fanout handoffs
retain their available layers and fixed copper; a layer conflict fails rather
than adding another dogbone. This distinguishes bus completion from the preceding fanout phase.

It honors bus layer restrictions and
preferences, keeps overlapping bus/pair groups atomic, and resolves signal layers before routing the interconnects. `fanout: "none"`
retains the fixed-layer input contract. A failed pipeline emits no partial
successful trace output.

The pipeline enables smooth length tuning and dense routing search. Declared
pairs use a common corridor and shared tuning curves; skew checks include fixed
fanout copper. Ordinary-run cleanup minimizes turns without increasing length.
The strict `BusLanesSolver` export remains available for callers that already
supply fanout handoffs.

The AM3352/RAM integration regression passes without saved geometry or a custom
algorithm. The four powered AM3352 placements complete in 15–27 seconds on the
measured machine; bounded search still reports failure when no acceptable route
set is found.

### Routed PR artifacts

PR images show completed routing only. The AM3352 overview above is rendered
from the three core acceptance snapshots: 16 inner1, 18 inner2, and 13 bottom
signals. Each panel shows its signal layer, with all 47 routes accounted for.
The core test writes snapshots only after connectivity, DRC, and quality checks.

Generate the four DDR artifacts with
`bun scripts/snapshot-routed-ddr.ts`; it verifies all cases solve and every
connection has a route before writing any images. Keep intermediate and failed
captures outside the repository.
